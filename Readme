# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST + CNN)

Hi there! 👋

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project where I built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**. It was a great way for me to get hands-on experience with deep learning and image classification using TensorFlow and Keras.



## 📚 What This Project Does

- Trains a CNN model on thousands of handwritten digit images (0–9)
- Predicts the digit from new unseen images
- Shows training/validation accuracy and loss using graphs
- Saves and loads the model for future predictions



## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow + Keras
- Matplotlib (for graphs)
- MNIST dataset (preloaded from Keras)



## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/digit-recognition-cnn.git
cd digit-recognition-cnn
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
Run the notebook or script:

Open Digit_Classifier_CNN.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook

OR run python train_model.py if you’re using the script version

📊 Model Accuracy
✅ Training Accuracy: ~99%

✅ Validation Accuracy: ~98%

Pretty cool results for a simple model on a clean dataset!

🖼️ Sample Output
Here’s how the model performs on some test images:


The model correctly predicted most digits and gave confidence scores for each class.

💡 Why I Made This
I wanted to learn how CNNs work from scratch and try building a simple image classification model. MNIST is a great dataset to get started with in the machine learning world.
